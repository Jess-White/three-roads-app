3 11 +

3 11 5 + -


Process:
* Look at each input
* Is it a number? Keep going
* Is it an operator? Do it
* Doing an operator is take the two preceding numbers and apply the operator (in the order the numbers are encountered)
* Basically replace the two numbers with the result
* Until you only have one number left and no operators

First input is 3, so we keep going
Second input is 11, so we keep going
Third input is 5, so we keep going
Fourth input is an operator, plus sign (+) so we apply it
So we take 11 + 5, which is 16
So we replace "11 5 +" with "16"

So our new set is 3 16

Fifth input is the negative sign, so we have 3 16 -

Do that operation, which is 3 - 16, which gives us -13

We only have one number left, -13, that's our answer


2 3 11 + 5 - *

First input is a number 2, so we keep going
Second input is a number 3, so we keep going
Third input is a number 11, so we keep going
Fourth input is our operand, +, so we add the previous two numbers: 3 + 11
And replace 3 11 + with 14, leaving 2 14 ...
The next input is a number 5, so we keep going
The next operand is a - sign, so we subtract the previous number 5 from the number preceding it 14
So then we have 2 9 ...
Then we hit the next input, which is a *, so we multiply the two preceding numbers, 2 * 9
So our final result is 18

I'll give a string of input: "2 3 11 + 5 - *"

Hit an operand
pop once to grab the "right side" number of the equation
pop twice to grab the "left side" number of the equation
perform a check to evaluate the operand
conditional
run the operand
take the result and add it to the end of the array using push
return index 0, the only item in the array, the answer
- nothing left in the string of input
- array has only one item

Need to process the input - separate it into individual numbers and operands
Need to keep track of the length of the input
Need to access the two most recent things
Need to move through the input - "keep going" probably using a loop?
Need to keep track of items that have gone before
Need to differentiate inputs between operands and numbers
Need to differentiate operands between + - * 
(Number inputs are one and two-digit numbers?)
Need to "grab" the two numbers preceding the operand
Need to perform the operand operation on those two numbers
For addition, need to add the two numbers
For multiplication, need to multiply the two numbers
For subtract, need to subtract the SECOND number grabbed from the FIRST number
For the process, need to replace (number_one, number_two, operand) with the result of the operation


Need to return a single number that is the product of the numbers and the operands using postfix notation
